## 🔍 About

This repository is an implementation of statistical regression models in **C++**, built from scratch as a learning and teaching tool.

The goal is to support:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Multivariate Regression
- Model Persistance (save/load)
- R² Score, MSE, and other metrics

> This project is built using open specifications, largely derived from [Wikipedia’s Regression Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis).
